        <h1> The story so far </h1>
    <p> Fifteen minutes have passed. The code has started to blur before your eyes.
       They scan in all directions for a glimpse of a TA, but this place is a ghost town.
        Youâ€™re left with only one option: Find Sam. The only problem is that finding Sam is not so simple.
        You must track his path step by step as it grows more and more complex.
      If you can successfully track Sam for twenty moves, you will have the opportunity to ask him for assistance.
